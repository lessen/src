## About

`eg` is a very simple test engine inspired by [Kent Beck's maker
video](https://goo.gl/0bCy0X).
    
### Usage

For every file `X.py` you want to show off, write a helper file `Xeg.py` whose
_last_ line is `eg()` and whose _first_ lines are

        import X
        from eg import eg

In the middle of `Xeg.py`, for every example you want to demonstrate, write one
functions, containing zero or more asserts.  Preface each such function with
`@eg`. For example:


       import X          # get the code you want to test
       from eg import eg # get this test engine
        
       @eg
       def lstTest():
         a={}
         a[1]=10
         assert a[1] == 10
    
       # Other example functions here
        
       # Finally
       eg()

After that:

- `python Xeg.py` will run all examples
- `python Xeg.py -?` will list all examples in the file.
- `python Xeg.py -- a b c ` will run just the examples `a,b,c`.
    
Note that this code catches any fails executions and, for each one, adds one to
a `FAIL` counter. Them at the end of the file, it reports the number of
functions that do not `FAIL`.

Also, if a function contains a doc string, then that is printed before each
function is run. Further, the time to run each example function is displayed
on the screen.

### To do
    
Find some what to hook this into some continuous integration testing tool
like https://travis-ci.org/.
